## TweakergeCompat

Fix the conflict between [Tweakerge](https://github.com/ThinkingStudios/Tweakeroo-Forge) and other mods.

### Why not merge into Tweakerge?
This is a development level issue, simply because each mod uses different mappings, which could lead to development level complexity if merged. (loom's remap for mods that use mojmap is not too good)

### Compat Patchs
- Fix compat with [TACZ](https://github.com/MCModderAnchor/TACZ).
